Ark Omega 3/10 Patch Notes:

-Revamped a lot of the functionality on Colossus now that it is tied into the Mythical group variant. 
-Aspect Souls fixed. Lots of changes to how/when they can be used. 
-Updated decay timers on set mannequins to cause them to take 16x longer to decay.
-Fixed a loophole that could allow uniques to come out with the incorrect name due to an index offset.
-All babies hatched from Unique parents will now be unique.
-Implemented potential fix for replication issues involving misc changes from variants. 
-Fixed omega gun functionality from invalid byte value. 
-Fixed Cursed bosses not dropping cursed items.
-Cursed bosses are no longer setup to drop artifacts.
-Cursed bosses now drop Tier+3 cursed armors instead of Tierx3, as Omega tier was dropping considerably too many items. 
-Fixed a bug causing tames to only take 5% damage. 
-Uberbleed removed from Unicorn and replaced with a normal bleed, as damage types that remove a % of the enemies health are not an intended balance in the mod.
-Implemented a possible terrain type check to catch terrain tracing for modded maps to allow chests and NPCs to spawn.
-Fixed a potential loophole that could cause loot chests to unload even when the player doesn't have the required essence.
-Edited the structure check functionality for loot chests to help prevent them from spawning too close to bases.
-Fixed a bug that can cause loot chests to stop spawning after one has been opened, only allowing the respawn to start when the server is restarted.
-Fixed a bug that could cause loot chest respawn timer to ignore the server setting from the admin panel and default to 10 seconds. 
-Pressing Escape no longer deletes miracles from the miracle tab in the Omegadex (this was only visual anyway).
-Set Mannequin max inventory size increased to 1000.
