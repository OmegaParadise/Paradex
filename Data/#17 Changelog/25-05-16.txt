30 New Uniques added from Hardcore Tournaments and all of the ASE alpha uniques were added to their base species.

Quantum Storage System Introduced:
---The quantum storage system is designed to be cloud-based infinite storage that removes the need for structures of any kind to store crafting materials. 
---You can instantly compress/decompress stored resources from anywhere. 
---This will remove the need for all dedicated storages and mods with their own pull system. 

Quantum Storage Button Explanation:
-Quantum storage buttons added to player inventory.
-These buttons (and their functions):
---Dimensional Sort Inventory: Pre-existing, this works almost the same as turning your inventory into a void vacuum, auto sorting anything in it that needs sorted.
---Quantum Compress Personal Resources: This will instantly compress any resources in your inventory into personal storage. This storage takes up no weight and can travel across maps.
---Quantum Compress Tribe Storage: This will instantly compress any resources into a tribe storage, accessible by all tribe members. This does NOT travel across maps.
---Personal Quantum Pull Menu: This pulls up a list of your personal stored items for you to pull into your own inventory.
---Tribe Quantum Pull Menu: This pulls up a list of your tribe's stored items for you to pull into your own inventory.
---Pull To Repair: Clicking an item and then clicking this button will instantly pull the resources from storages and repair the item in one click. Without selecting an item, it will attempt to repair all items in your inventory.
---Pull To Craft: Click an item and clicking this button will instantly pull the resources needed to craft this item from storages.

Ark Omega 5/16 Hotfix Patch Notes:

-Fixed a bug with the harvesting component on the Resource group variant to be invalid. 
-Fixed a bug preventing the blue ring for Cosmic variants when using tracker from displaying correctly.
-Fixed a bug with Tracker having client relevancy issues that could stop the icons from displaying correctly.
