Ark Omega 3/21 Patch Notes: 

-Fixed a problem with Ravagers not saving their variant/tier/paragon data. This will not retroactively fix Ravagers tamed before this fix. 
-Over Easy full set bonus changed from "Reveals Nearby Loot Chests" to "Gives Permanent Treasure Buff".
-Fixed problems with Lightningburst in the Omegadex displaying Earthburst.
-Fixed a check preventing set mannequins from having 1000 slots.
-Fixed the description on Unique Charms. Still working on something to automatically update existing charms (rerolling them will fix them).
-Fixed the description on Endless Essence.
-Fixed a possible cause for eggs disappearing when they hit the ground. Old eggs from before this patch will not likely be fixed.
-Temporarily removed support for Maeguana
-Fixed Archelon's not getting replaced with Omega versions on spawn.
-Fixed broken references to Fireburst and Windburst sound effects.
-Emitter system established for greatly improved performance.
-Ability switched over to using PrimalEmitters instead of a global ability actor to process particles and sounds in order to reduce replication amounts.
-Unique saddle system implemented.
-Updated the text on the Unstable Water to show that it is an infinite water source for the Soul Furnace and Farming dinos.
-Added a double check for existing saves that should update the player to have the correct buffs. You should still respawn your player anyway.
