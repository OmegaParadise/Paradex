-Fairly is no longer a ticking heal, but instead an instant-cast heal in the area that heals everything for 25% of their max health and then applies a slow healing tick buff.
-Reflective no longer decreases damage taken, and instead deals damage to the attacker based on 100% damage taken. It is also now a buff applied by the variant.
-Spiritual no longer modifies the speed stat, and instead uses the buff to increase the dinos speed. This should make the speed work with uniques.
-Gorgon is now in an AoE instead of in front of the caster, and deals 100% of ability damage instead of very small damage.
