NPC Quick-Guide:

1. NPCs always spawn at loot chests. This allows the greatest diversity of spawn locations and doesn't conflict with dino spawns.
2. Basic through Elite tier spawn naturally. Higher tiers spawn based on a point system earned from killing Leaders.
3. NPCs spawn 5 at a time. 4 normal, and 1 Leader. At Omega tier, the leader is replaced with the Chief.
4. All NPCs are wearing a full armor set. Leaders use Unique Weapons, Chiefs use Legendary weapons.
5. Set pieces and unique weapons are highly likely to drop from their repsective NPCs.
6. The Chief will always drop a cursed set and a max stat Legendary Weapon, and reset the points for that tribe.
