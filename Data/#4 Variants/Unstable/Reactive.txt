<span style="color:orange;">Reactive</span>: Water is both the enemy and best friend of these creatures, as they have a violent
interaction with it. When raining or entering water, the Reactive creature will start to emit a
powerful aura of radiation and heat, doing passive damage to anything in the area. While a
proven method for farming creatures, it can also draw unwanted aggro from enemies in the
area that would otherwise not attack. Shortly after exiting the water, or the rain stops, the
reaction will subside and the creature will go back to normal.
