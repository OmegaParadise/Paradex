<span style="color:orange;">Volatile</span>: These creatures are constantly on the edge of a bad reaction. They can
spontaneously erupt into a powerful gas cloud, poisoning enemies and slowing them. This
can happen both while they are attacking, or even while a passive Volatile creature is
being attacked. This volatile cloud is dealt as Earth damage, so make sure your
resistances are up before fighting the stronger ones.

Pressing Prone(X) releases a small explosion followed by a volatile gas cloud. The cloud
will linger for a bit, both poisoning and slowing enemies as it ticks away at their health.
