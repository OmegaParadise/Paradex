<span style="color:gray;">Wireless Controller</span>: Controllers are in charge of aggression levels of nearby enemies. They can use a
taunt that forces enemies to attack them, while debuffing the enemy so that they are
stunned when attacking the Controller.

Pressing Prone(X) will taunt enemies, forcing them to attack the Controller instead of other
allies. They can even make most passive creatures attack them. Attacking the controller
while taunted will stun the enemy.
