<span style="color:gray;">Armored</span>: The 7th Variant of Guardian. Armored creatures gain increased damage reduction
as their health decreases, making them increasingly more difficult to deal with as the fight
goes on. Your best strategy is to kill them in a single blow, or get them below 1% health
which will deactivate their damage reduction. Melee and Ability damages are also
decreased as the Armored creature's health decreases.
