<span style="color:yellow;">Treasure</span>: Guardians of the chests, keepers of dynamic items, these living artifacts wander
around holding the secrets to the locations of many items.

Killing a Treasure variant will give anyone nearby during its death a Treasure Hunter buff,
revealing the location of any loot chests they come within range of and making it so your
ridden tame uses 100% of your equipped magic find.

Treasure creatures can only be tamed using Unique Kibble.
