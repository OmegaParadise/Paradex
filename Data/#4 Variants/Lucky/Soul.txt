<span style="color:yellow;">Soul</span>: Soul creatures are made purely of souls. Being made of such means they are also
extremely hard to hit, as your attacks have a great chance of passing right through them.
When killed, they drop a massive cache of souls. The number of souls dropped it based on
the number of kibble it would normally require to tame that creature, so taming speed will
have an effect on the number of souls dropped. The type of soul dropped will be based on
the spawn rarity of the variants in that group.

Soul creatures can only be tamed using Unique Kibble.
