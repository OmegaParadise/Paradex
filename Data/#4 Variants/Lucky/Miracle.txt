<span style="color:yellow;">Miracle</span>: These very elusive variants have the ability to change server settings when killed,
changing many aspects of gameplay for a limited amount of time. They are rare, often hard
to see, with a high chance to dodge, and increased speed.

When a Miracle creature is killed, if a new miracle is created or an existing one boosted,
there will be a server wide notification that a Miracle has been performed. The miracles can
be found in their own tab on the Guide.

Miracle creatures can only be tamed using Unique Kibble.
