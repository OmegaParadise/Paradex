<span style="color:purple;">Overlord</span>: The boss. Overlord's have dominion over any lesser creature of their species.
When they call, a small horde of minions will appear of the same species as the Overlord,
ready to fight for it to the death. These minions are smaller and slower, but the group of
them is much stronger than the Overlord itself.

Pressing Prone(X) will summon minions at reduced size and speed. These minions will
behave exactly as the Overlord, and are set to Attack My Target and Follow Me by default.
