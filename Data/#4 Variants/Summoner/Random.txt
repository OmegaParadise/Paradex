<span style="color:purple;">Random</span>: Random are the most unpredictable creatures in Ark Omega. They have no
control over what they summon, as it can be any creature from any group.

Pressing Prone(X) will summon completely random minions, with random variants and
duration. Even a Random Dodo can summon an Uncontrollable Titanosaur as a minion.
Water dinos will only be summoned in the water.
