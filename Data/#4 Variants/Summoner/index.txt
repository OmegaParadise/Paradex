<span style="color:purple;">SUMMONER</span>:
Summoners are able to bring minions into the battle to aid when its needed. Each of them
has a very unique type of summon, and can be useful in a number of circumstances. The
minions are not permanent, and will disappear after they're time is up. Minions cannot be
ridden, or placed into a soul trap or cryopod.
