<span style="color:purple;">Necromancer</span>: Able to manipulate the dead, the Necromancer can revive nearby corpses to
rejoin the fight, although on its side this time. As long as the corpses still exist, the
Necromancer will bring them back to life, fully healed and ready for combat. They will retain
almost everything they had in their life, including their abilities. The Necromancer can prove
extremely valuable in many fights, bringing back the stronger fallen creatures to do battle
for it, making it able to defeat things many times stronger than itself.

Pressing Prone(X) will revive all nearby corpses, restoring their tier and variant, allowing
them to fight for the Necromancer for a short time. They are set to Attack My Target and
Follow Me by default.
