<span style="color:purple;">Familiar</span>: Many minions! The Familiar can summon a large group of angry bats, hell-bent
on killing anything in the area. This swarm increases in numbers based on Tier, as does the
individual strength of each bat.

Pressing Prone(X) will summon a group of Uncontrollable Onycs that will instantly begin
attacking all enemies in the area for a short time. They will spawn at the same Tier as the
Familiar creature.
