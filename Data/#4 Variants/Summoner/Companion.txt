<span style="color:purple;">Companion</span>: Everyone wants a companion. A minion that stays with you always,
protecting you through thick and thin. The summoned Companion is very strong, takes
little damage, and has a very special ability. It can steal the variants of anything it kills!
You can only have 1 companion at a time.

Pressing Prone(X) will create a single Companion, which will stay with you until death, or
you leave it. You can only have one companion at a time, so pressing X will destroy your
current one and replace it with a new one. Your tame's melee and ability damage is added
to that of the Companion's. Also, you can use the wheel to disable ability stealing when
you get an acceptable variant.
