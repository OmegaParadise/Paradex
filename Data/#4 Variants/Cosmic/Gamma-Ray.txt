<span style="color:blue;">Gamma-Ray</span>: Similar to Starfire in damage output, Gamma-Ray tears a hole in the sky to
allow powerful gamma-rays to strike the ground, dealing reactive tick damage to enemies
in the area.

Pressing Prone(X) forces a Gamma-Ray to strike the ground in front of you, dealing tick
damage to anything nearby until it goes away. The damage is dealt in a vertical cylinder in
the location of the Gamma-Ray.
