<span style="color:blue;">Comet</span>: One large Comet. These creatures will create a single large comet that crashes into
the ground in front of them. A direct hit means incredible damage is dealt, while an indirect
impact will cause damage based on proximity to the Comet. Comet can make excellent
boss fighters with their high direct-hit impact.

Pressing Prone(X) calls down a single Comet, which can deal great impact damage if it
does a direct hit, with lesser damage for indirect hits.
