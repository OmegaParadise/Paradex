<span style="color:red;">Knockback</span>: Keeping enemies at range, that's the point of the Knockback creatures. They
have a chance with every attack to deal a blow that sends the enemy flying a short
distance, leaving it temporarily stunned before it is able to re-enter battle. With enough
consecutive attacks, a Knockback creature can keep an enemy outside of attack range,
pummelling it without ever letting it get close enough to fight back.
