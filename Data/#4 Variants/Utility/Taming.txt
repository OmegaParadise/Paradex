<span style="color:brown;">Taming</span>: Taming dinos can make taming other creatures extremely easy. They all deal
torpor! Taming dinos deal torpor with every attack, including some minor torpor over-time
after the hit. This can be used to bypass the need for tranqs in some situations. Taming
dinos also cause food to drain faster for KO dinos in the immediate area, increasing the rate
at which they eat kibble and thus the speed at which they tame. NOTE: Taming dinos do
NOT deal Raid Torpor. They will not KO any creature that requires Raid Torpor.
