<span style="color:brown;">UTILITY</span>:
Utility dinos aren't meant for combat. They are here to serve a greater purpose. These
purposes are usually centered around basic Ark functions, like taming or crafting. They can
remove the need for increased INI settings for these basic Ark functions that often throw off
balance and progression, by introducing a balanced way to reduce the need for grinding.
Because of this, Utility dinos are often very rare, and their souls are used to craft incredibly
valuable items.
