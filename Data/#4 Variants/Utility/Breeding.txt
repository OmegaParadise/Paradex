<span style="color:brown;">Breeding</span>: Breeding dinos alter various functions of Ark Breeding. They provide the
Oviraptor Egg buff to nearby creatures, without the need to be placed on wander. This buff
increases egg laying rates for any nearby creature with an egg icon above its head.

The main feature of Breeding creatures is their ability to greatly reduce the time needed
between matings on nearby creatures. Feeding an unfertilized egg of the same tier or
higher to a Breeding creature will activate a timer above its head to show how long the
effect will last. Feeding multiple eggs increases the duration of the effect. This will cause
nearby creatures that are currently in mating cooldown to have their timers tick faster,
allowing them to mate sooner. This must be done by using the "Consume All Eggs" option
at the bottom of the inventory screen or it will not apply the bonus.

PLEASE NOTE: The oviraptor egg buff does not stack with any other method of providing
this buff. It is an Ark mechanic that modders do not have access to, and it cannot be made
to stack. Placing a breeding dino with an Oviraptor, Hatchery, and anything else that
provides this buff is a waste, as it will only be applied ONCE.
