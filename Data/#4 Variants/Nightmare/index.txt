<span style="color:black;">NIGHTMARE</span>:
Nightmare creatures are the things that go bump in the night. During the day, they often
behave like typical creatures. During the night, their abilities are greatly enhanced. They are
also highly aggressive at night, often hunting you from a distance whenever you are in the
area. Most nightmare creatures also gain Nightvision, with the ability to see enemies from
great distances, even though walls, foliage, and terrain.
