<span style="color:black;">Boogeyman</span>: Ruler of the night, the Boogeyman is an absolute force to be reckoned with.
A fairly normal creature during the day, at night they become covered in a solid black
cloak, unable to be targeted by other creatures. At night, they also gain huge damage
reduction, night vision, and the ability to jump-scare enemies with a powerful roar.

Pressing Prone(X) will make the Boogeyman release a terrifying Roar. This will do huge
damage to the enemies, as if scaring the life out of them. It will also force them to flee for
an extended period.
