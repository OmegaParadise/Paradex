<span style="color:lightgray;">Disruptor</span>: The 7th Variant of Ethereal. This variant's purpose is to stop enemies from
using abilities, which can turn the tide of almost any battle. This will not prevent passive
abilities like Knockback or Resource shards, but rather activated abilities. It is also
immune to damage from Disrupted creatures, allowing it to survive retaliation. One major
bonus of this variant is that it removes dodge chance from Lucky variant creatures. Upon
deactivation, a cooldown buff is applied to enemies which prevents them from being
disrupted for 30 seconds. This pairs very well with Element Sickness from the Element
variant.

Pressing Prone(X) releases a wave of Disruption, stopping enemies from using Activated
abilities, and even removing elemental immunities from Gods.
