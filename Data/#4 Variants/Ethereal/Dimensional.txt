<span style="color:lightgray;">Dimensional</span>: An ability you have to see to believe, Dimensional creatures completely
ignore air and water. They have no concept of either. Dimensional land creatures can walk
or fly right into the ocean, and Dimensional water creatures can swim right out into the sky
allowing you to use your favorite water tame on land. The Jump(Space) can be used to
toggle flight on even ground creatures. They use no oxygen, and with their Dimensional
Vision activated, your rider will not use oxygen either.

Pressing Prone(X) will remove all water from sight, making it completely invisible. You will
be able to see the very depths of the ocean floor from the sky, allowing unlimited
underwater exploration.

NOTE: Dimensional water tames should not be left out during a restart. The game may see
them as water tames before seeing them as dimensional, and delete them!
