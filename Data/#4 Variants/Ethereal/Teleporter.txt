<span style="color:lightgray;">Teleporter</span>: Teleporter creatures are able to travel short distances in a flash. They will
teleport when hit unless ridden, to a random location in front of them. This will do explosive
AOE damage at both the location it teleported away from, and the location it teleported to.

Pressing Prone(X) will instantly teleport. Holding Prone(X) will show the location indicator
on where you are going to teleport to, and releasing will teleport you there.
