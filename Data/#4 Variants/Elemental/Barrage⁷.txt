<span style="color:yellow;">Barrage</span>: The 7th Variant of Elemental. Barrage rains down a rapid attack of chromatic
cannonballs that impact as a random elemental ball. Many of them are fired in a short
period of time, and they are fired directly at surrounding targets. There isn't any way to
control which element they will deal damage for, but the damage dealt is usually
formidable.

Pressing Prone(X) will start the Barrage, firing chromatic cannonballs directly at nearby
targets.
