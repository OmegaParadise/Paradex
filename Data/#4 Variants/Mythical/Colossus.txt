<span style="color:lightgreen;">Colossus</span>: Massive creatures, significantly larger than original. They have greatly
increased attack range, with ones able to land on the ground also being able to perform a
powerful stomp attack on anything in the area. The stomp will not effect flyers or water
creatures in the area.

Pressing Prone(X) with a Colossus dino currently on the ground will perform a powerful
ground stomp, also damaging other creatures on the ground. Water creatures and
creatures currently flying cannot use the stomp, but are not effected by it either.
