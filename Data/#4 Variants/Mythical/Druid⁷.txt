<span style="color:lightgreen;">Druid</span>: The 7th Variant of Mythical. Druid creatures leverage the power of the forest titan
to raise toxic trees and ensnaring vines. While the vines to not deal damage, they root
anything on the ground, preventing it from moving. The summoned trees will find the
nearest enemy and begin firing projectiles that deal damage, slow, and blind.

Pressing Prone(X) spawns a Druid Grove in front of the Druid creature, creating a large
area of vines and spawning a number of trees that fire projectiles directly as nearby
enemies.
