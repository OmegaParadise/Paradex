<span style="color:lightgray;">RESOURCE</span>:
Resource creatures are made out of their corresponding resource. They produce it, and poop
it. They are much heavier than normal, and take 80% damage reduction. Their corpses are
harvested as if you were harvesting a node of that resource. While they have no special
abilities, they have huge passive damage reduction of 80% and when hit, have a chance to
release a shard of itself, which will explode after a few seconds. Each resource type has an
elemental weakness they bypasses their damage reduction. They also take double damage
from the Multi-Tool, which can be used early on to kill and harvest these creatures, or KO
them in club mode.
