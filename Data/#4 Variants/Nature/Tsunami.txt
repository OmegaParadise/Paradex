<span style="color:green;">Tsunami</span>: Tsunami creatures have the power to manipulate, even create, powerful waves of
water that can damage, drown, and even push back enemies.

Pressing Prone(X) creates a poweful wave that quickly spreads outwards from the Tsunami
creature. The wave will damage anything caught in it, drain their oxygen, and can even push
them away from the Tsunami creature.
