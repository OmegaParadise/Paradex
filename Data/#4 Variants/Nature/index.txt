<span style="color:green;">NATURE</span>:
Forces of Nature, literally. Nature creatures are the ultimate elemental creatures, dealing
elemental damage with abilities that are based on natural disasters. They easily rival
Cosmic in their ability to dish out widespread damage and destruction. Afterall, this is their
home turf. Nature creatures are rare, but should always be approached with caution. Their
abilities are able to devistate large area, and often cannot be avoided or dodge in any way.
They also cause elemental status effects and follow the elemental weakness/resistance
system, so prepare those imbues!
