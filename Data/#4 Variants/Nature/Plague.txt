<span style="color:green;">Plague</span>: Plague is an ability with a lot of potential. When a Plague creature uses this
ability, it will release a gas cloud, infecting enemies with a debuff. The infected will take
tick damage as earth damage over a time, and if they die while infected, will erupt into
their own Plague. This can create immense chains of Plague spreading across the land,
wiping out huge groups of tightly packed enemies in seconds.

Pressing Prone(X) will release a deadly Plague Cloud that travels outward. This will infect
all nearby enemies and they will immediately start taking tick damage based on the attack
of the Plague creature. If killed while infected, each enemy will release an additional
Plague, starting the chain over.
