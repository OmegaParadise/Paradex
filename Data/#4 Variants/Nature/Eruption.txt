<span style="color:green;">Eruption</span>: Containing the explosive pressure of a Volcano, Eruption creatures are capable
of blowing their top, spewing out molten projectiles in every direction that deal heavy
damage on impact and large-radius explosive damage. With some careful practice, its
possible to hit enemies with multiple Eruption projectiles for bonus damage.

Pressing Prone(X) will send a number of large molten projectiles into the sky, raining them
down in random directions and locations around the Eruption creature, causing explosions
on impact and dealing fire damage to anything in the area.
