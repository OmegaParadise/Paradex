Bosses:
These are the first group of bosses that you'll summon, by using the Omega Beacon.
The Omega Beacon is unlocked by killing a wild creature that is Prime tier or higher. You will unlock the
Tekgram, and can craft it at the Omega Workbench. The Omega Beacon can be used to summon wild tameable
creatures, or you can place 100 souls inside to summon a Beacon Boss.
These bosses will spawn with a variant from the group of souls you have used in the beacon. These bosses
cannot be tamed. They must be killed. Killing them rewards a Boss Soul, which will appear as an orb on the
ground. They may also unlock Tekgrams.

You have choices from here.
1. Feed the Boss Soul to an Elite tier of the same variant, to increase its tier to Prime.
2. Place the Boss Soul back into the beacon to summon a Master of the same variant. The tier of the Master
will be based on the tier of the Boss Soul used to summon it. Be warned, Masters have 1Ox the base stats of a
boss, with a random 2nd variant from within their group.
