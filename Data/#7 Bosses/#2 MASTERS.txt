Masters:
The Masters will likely be your first real challenge. It is not recommended to move into fighting Masters until
you are able to farm a Prime tier beacon boss of that variant.
Summon a Master by placing a Boss Soul into the Omega Beacon. The variant/tier of the Master will match
that of the Boss Soul used to create it. Make sure you always summon a basic tier Master first, before
attempting to move onto the higher tiers.

Killing a Master will unlock the Omega Altar, and drop a Master Soul on the ground. The Master Soul can be
used to rank up your tame to Apex tier.

You have choices from here.
1. Feed the Soul to a Prime of the same variant. This will rank it up to Apex, doubling its stats.
2. Collect the souls of every variant within that group, to place in the Omega Altar to summon a Group Master.
