Group Masters:
Group Masters are much more difficult than the Masters you fought before. They have the abilities of all 6
variants within a group. Killing them is meant to be a raid, and killing them with just a single creature is very
unlikely until you're later in the game. Strategy is a must, and fighting them in tribes or even with allied tribes
will make these fights considerably easier. Summon a group master by placing one of each Master soul within
a group (exclusing the 7th variant) into the Omega Altar.

Killing a Group Master will drop a Group Master Soul on the ground. The Group Master Soul can be used to rank
up your tame to Ultimate tier.

You have choices from here.
1. Feed the Soul to an Apex of a variant within the group of the Group Master killed. This will rank it up to
Ultimate, doubling its stats.
2. Place the Group Master soul into the Altar with a matching Group Master soul to summon a Unique Group
Master.
3. Place the Group Master soul into the Altar with the 7th variant Master soul from the same group to summon
the Perfect Group Master.
