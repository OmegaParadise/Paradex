Unique Group Masters:
Unique Group Masters are typically where the late-game starts. They take things significantly further than
Group Masters. They have Group Variants, but 2 of them, and 10x the base stats of a Group master. To
Summon one, put the 2 matching Group Masters Souls in the Omega Altar. Be warned, Unique Group Masters
have 12 variant abilities and the fight can be visually intense.

Current Unique Group Masters:
-Apocalypse: Cosmic/Nature
-Anima: Mythical/Summoner
-Alchemy: Unstable/Elemental
-Indestructus: Guardian/Resource
-Infinity: Ethereal/Utilit
-Sin: Nightmare/Rage

Killing a Unique Group Master will drop a Unique Group Master Soul on the ground. The Group Master Soul can
be used to rank up your tame to Ancient tier.

You have choices from here.
1. Feed the Soul to an Ultimate of a variant within the grousp of the Unique Group Master killed. This will rank it
up to Ancient, doubling its stats.
2. Place the Unique Group Master soul into the Omega Beacon to summon an Aspect.
3. Place the Unique Group Master soul into the Altar with the 2 matching 7th variant Master souls from the
same groups to summon the Perfect Unique Group Master.
