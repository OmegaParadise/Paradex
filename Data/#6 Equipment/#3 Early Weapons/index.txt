Early game weapons are obtainable as soon as you start playing. They can be crafted
in the Omega Workbench once you reach the level required for the engrams.

The unique versions follow the same drops as early game sets, obtainable from any
creature with a variant, with the item dropped coordinating with the group of dino that is
killed.

When unique weapons drop, they have a 10% chance to be Legendary.
