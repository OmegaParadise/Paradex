Early game sets are obtainable as soon as you start playing.

Early game sets drop from any enemy with a variant. The set drop coordinates with the
group of the enemy killed, giving you a matching set piece from that set. Click each set
to get a full description of the pieces, along with the group that the set is from.

Their bonuses coordinate with early game weapons.
