Additional Info: "You are stronger for each nearby enemy" works similar to the Pygmy
pack bonus. You get increased damage output and reduced damage taken for each
enemy nearby, up to 30."Enemies burn while sirened" means they are set on fire when
Siren is applied with the bow. The fire damage is both increased by your melee stat
and the total quality rating of your set items.

Drops from Mythical variants.
